<p>Caste and religion.
    It might be the go-to topic of discussion when considering the social issues plaguing our country. Many argue that even the reservations aren’t necessary anymore and that it only serves to divide and provide undue advantage to those who don’t need it, but the one thing I observed is those who use such arguments rather tend to not consider the horrible situations they have to confront through out their life. Even you must have faced some situations or know people who had to where caste played a part in depriving them of their life, their happiness or their legal rights. We see everyday how matrimonies advertise on the basis of caste, how inter-caste married couples are shamed, threatened, lynched and forced to part ways or killed by mobs or even in several situations alienated and punished by their own family. A Dalit man in Madhya Pradesh beaten for allegedly touching the food of upper caste men, another Dalit man in Uttar Pradesh assaulted and abused with an iron rod for the sole reason of being a Dalit. A politician in Andhra Pradesh calling upon his followers to commit violent acts against individuals from the other caste and these few instances are not the only ones, these cases occur with such frequency that they do not appear to be shocking anymore but just another day in our life. The optimists of the current generation and the future generations hold their breath hoping one day they would they can teach their children to treat others the way they deserve to be treated, that this would change and Indians could treat each other with respect, debate not with violence and hate but with intellect and patience, but like any problem the solution can only be arrived at when the cause of the problem in known and it is not surprising to come to the conclusion that religion is the cause of caste motivated crimes and discrimination in India and the Hindus.

<p>In this article we will concentrate on the caste system of Hindus in India. The one man considered as the greatest fighter against caste discrimination is Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the philosopher, economist, politician, social reformer and anthropologist. He struggled with caste discrimination his entire life and rose to a position that gave him the power to bring change in our centuries old system of dividing each other not on the basis of intelligence and skill but the family a person is born into. Hinduism is well known not just in southern Asia but the entire world and is seen as one of the oldest and wide spread religion of the world but many tend to conclude that the fact that it has survived through the centuries proves that it’s right and there are no major flaws in it and hence it is not to be questioned. Followers of Hinduism are taught early in their life that it is not right to question the ways of the religion and to have faith. The thing about faith is it is blind, faith doesn’t require one to think objectively and Hindu texts constantly include cases of punishment to those who question, who decide to choose their own path. In a published speech of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, a speech which he was not permitted to deliver for reasons which will be obvious to anyone who reads it, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar dives into precisely the issues mentioned above. He asks and answers questions that many do not have the courage or intellect to speak about. “The names, Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra, are names which are associated with a definite and fixed notion in the mind of every Hindu. That notion is that of a hierarchy based on birth. So long as these names continue, Hindus will continue to think of the Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra as hierarchical divisions of high and low, based on birth, and act accordingly. The Hindu must be made to unlearn all this.”, he lays out his reasoning as to how such a hierarchical division of the Hindu population prevented them from ever rising up as a united front as how it took place in the French revolution.

<p>Dr. Ambedkar criticizes Plato’s republic in how Plato fails to perceive an individual as nothing more than a cog in a machine that is bigger than himself. This hierarchical segregation of the Hindus made them not too powerful but also not so weak as to rebel against a system that restricted them of free will and penalized them when questions were asked. He also spells out why he thinks the issue of caste cannot be cracked without diminishing the illusion of absolute power of religion and Vedas over the masses and why he this it is impossible to achieve this. He briefly explains with the example of Ramayana of Rama killing Shambuka and how people misunderstand the situation and blame Rama for killing Shambuka without. Ram Raj was based on Chaturvarnya which is the division of society into four classes, the Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. As a king of such kingdom, it was his duty to kill Shambuka who wanted to be a Brahman. This proves how the texts of Hinduism indicates the death penalty as a necessity as punishment for those who do not obey the system of system and gives just an example how religion places a deeper role in the discrimination that arises from caste. This system ensures Brahmins are the cultivators of knowledge, Kshatriyas as the warriors, Vaishyas as traders and Shudras as servants. This denied the tools needed by anyone who wanted to rise against this system as a united front as they are prohibited from pursuing skills of the other caste and hence depriving them of the opportunity to break free. In the 21st century, where everyone desires individuality and freedom, those who advocate for any form of caste system should have been considered irrelevant but the caste system is also precisely the reason for such people to acquire the support needed. The hierarchical system makes those who want to fight for equality with the “upper caste” also reminds that this could also lead to them treating those of the “lower caste” as equals. The question arises whether a Hindu is even allowed to question the Vedas and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar proves using the very Vedas how they prohibit any Hindu from questioning and disobeying the writings. So, if an average person in the modern world who is born a Hindu questions the religion and its beliefs, would he still be considered a Hindu? If he refused to comply with any ritual that makes no sense to him, would he still be considered a Hindu? Not according to the Vedas which are explained in detail by Dr. Ambedkar in his published speech just like how anyone who criticizes the government are labelled “anti-national”. Families of the so-called upper castes control the wealth and influence in rural areas in India even today which has been passed down through generations and will probably be passed down for several generations to come. No one knows when or if this issue will ever see its final days in our country but all one can do is do their best and hope for the better.</p>

    Before ending this article or blog or whatever this is, I would like to provide a reason to stay optimistic, several experiments and studies prove that educating any part of society with a social issue and explaining how it effects an individual proved to be effective in solving a problem rather than shaming and alienating those who do not understand how their actions affect others in the society. An example of this can be seen when a social organization decided to improve awareness among the residents of a particular society which is one of the many places in India that still practice FGM or Female Genital Mutilation which is a horrible practice still followed today in several parts of the world and how trying to educate the residents about the issue produced better results in reducing the number of cases of FGM. We have seen the society evolve and ban practices such as sati and dowry, though it is not entirely eradicated the improvement gives a minute sense of hope. With the same methods maybe one day our society might be free from cancerous issues such as caste, religion, region, gender and language-based discrimination. With this in mind, I would like to end with a suggestion for the reader of this to read the published speech by Dr. Ambedkar which is available for free on google play books, <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Annihilation_of_Caste.html?id=Eio8BQAAQBAJ">“Annihilation of Caste"</a>and in the words of M. K. Gandhi, “Be the change you want to see in the world”.
